Hi everyone! My name is Radhika Srivastava and I am a second-year Industrial Engineering student at Georgia Tech. I am currently in Cape Town for a study abroad program where I am studying Data Science. I chose to study Data Science, because I have alwas been interested in operations-oriented data analytics and thought this program would be the perfect way for me to learn more about my interests.

Besides learning here in Cape Town, I love traveling and visiting all the amazing attractions and natural beauty this city has offer. I love traveling, and hope to do much more in the future. Besides traveling, I enjoy writing, bicyling, reading, and baking. 

When I'm not studying at school, I am heavily involved in my campus community. I am the social director of Alpha Kappa Psi, a professional co-ed fraternity, and enjoy planning smallevents for our members. I'm also work with TedXGT, where I help set up Ted talks for our campus community. Outside of campus, I am training to become volunteer for the Amercrisis crisis text line.

I'm so excited for the rest of my summer and for my next three years of college to see what I can learn and what new experiences I can have!
