## The Conversion Package 


When creating my first package in R, I wanted to make a something that would make truly be useful and have adequate functionality. Over the past few weeks I have been in Cape Town, I realized that it would be useful to have a tool to convert standard units used in America, to metric units used in South Africa (and the rest of the world). So, I decided to make a R package that would do just that. 

Here is the code for the function that I used to make my package:

```{r}
conversion <- function(type,value)
  {
  if(type=="w")
  {print("Weight Conversion")
    return(value * 0.453592)}
  else if(type=="d")
  {print("Distance Conversion")
    return(value * 0.3048)}
  else if (type=="t")
  {print("Temperature Conversion")
      return((value-32)*.5556)}
  else {
    (print("Invalid Conversion Type"))
    return (-1)
  }
}
```
